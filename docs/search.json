More specifically, many marginalized groups have been impacted by certain events and policies– Jim Crow laws, red-lining, the Great Recession, etc. Viewing the long-term and short-term impacts of these events could help improve future policies and actions by the government.\nThis research topic of Race and Wealth is constantly evolving– incorporating new variables and details as society learns more about the history about the U.S. My hypothesis is that overall marginalized groups wealth have increased throughout history with the distribution within these groups widening.\nThe types of variables in my research question include year (quantitive), race (categorical), income mean (quantitative), income bracket (categorical), and income distribution (quantitative).\nLiterature\n\n\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.html \nOverall this article looks at recent trends in wealth between different races in the U.S. It found that Black and Hispanic families’ incomes rose dramatically after experiencing the aftermath Great Recession more severely. Additionally, it found that within every race, wealth was significantly higher for middle-aged families compared to older and younger families. However, the disparity between these subgroups is still apparent. Finally the article details the disparity in retirement account ownership between different races.\nOverall this research paper looks at many factors contributing to wealth in a short period of time (2007-2019). My analysis however will do the opposite- look at just one factor, race, and see how that impacts income distribution over a long period of time (1963 - 2019)."

We were thinking of potentially going the route of number of occourance differences between multiple variables but if needed that could be swapped.\nThe mystery genre has evolved a lot in the past few years with the subgenre of Murder Mystery being very popular. As Scooby Doo is an older show that has been around for many years, we want to see if there is a difference in the gender roles played by the characters in Scooby Doo as time has passed. As other films and shows have started to have more female leads, we were wondering if older shows would slowly adapt to that syle. My hypothesis is that in the later seasons of the we will see more occurrences of the female characters doing generally more actions (revealing the monster, being the culprit, etc…)\nThe types of variables in the research question are who revealed the monster(categorical) gender of the culprit (categorical), who was caught by the monster (categorical), who actually caught the monster(categorical), and if the culprit was arrested(categorical)"

Asian Social Science, 10(3), 44.\nThis article talks about how gender roles are portrayed on Cartoon Network shows. The article concludes, that after looking at animated series and cartoons broadcasted from January to July in 2013, that Cartoon Network portrays male and female characters in a biased and stereotypical way. They claim that this plays an important role in shaping and constructing ideas about gender roles, especially in the minds of younger children who are watching the shows. While this does give good evidence, I think the timeline of only using data from 6 months does not tell the whole story of the evolution of how gender roles are portrayed in television.\nThe article mentioned above is almost 10 years old at this point and only analyzes a small portion of time. Scooby Doo has been around for over 50 years and in that time may have changed as people became more aware of the gender roles and how commonly they are stereotyped in television. Our research question will build off this article by conducting a similar test, but it will be focus on a longer scale and how one specific show has changed over time."

The Bechdel Test is a simple test that assesses movies based on three criteria: does a movie have at least two named female characters? Do these named characters have at least one conversation? Is this conversation about something that is not about a man? We were surprised by the number of movies that did not pass this seemingly basic test, even in 2016. This article further explored diversity in the film industry, testing movies on whether the on-set crew were 50% women (of which none of these top 50 movies passed), and explored the racial diversity in the film industry. \nTo further explore female representation and characterization in the film industry, we want to investigate the relationship between film budget and profit in regard to whether films pass the Bechdel test. \n(article: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/)\n\nGlimpse of data\n\nbechdel<- read.csv(file = 'data/bechdel_test.csv')\nglimpse(bechdel)\n\nRows: 1,794\nColumns: 34\n$ year          <int> 2013, 2012, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 20…\n$ imdb          <chr> \"tt1711425\", \"tt1343727\", \"tt2024544\", \"tt1272878\", \"tt0…\n$ title         <chr> \"21 &amp; Over\", \"Dredd 3D\", \"12 Years a Slave\", \"2 Guns…\n$ test          <chr> \"notalk\", \"ok-disagree\", \"notalk-disagree\", \"notalk\", \"m…\n$ clean_test    <chr> \"notalk\", \"ok\", \"notalk\", \"notalk\", \"men\", \"men\", \"notal…\n$ binary        <chr> \"FAIL\", \"PASS\", \"FAIL\", \"FAIL\", \"FAIL\", \"FAIL\", \"FAIL\", …\n$ budget        <int> 13000000, 45000000, 20000000, 61000000, 40000000, 225000…\n$ domgross      <chr> \"25682380\", \"13414714\", \"53107035\", \"75612460\", \"9502021…\n$ intgross      <chr> \"42195766\", \"40868994\", \"158607035\", \"132493015\", \"95020…\n$ code          <chr> \"2013FAIL\", \"2012PASS\", \"2013FAIL\", \"2013FAIL\", \"2013FAI…\n$ budget_2013   <int> 13000000, 45658735, 20000000, 61000000, 40000000, 225000…\n$ domgross_2013 <chr> \"25682380\", \"13611086\", \"53107035\", \"75612460\", \"9502021…\n$ intgross_2013 <chr> \"42195766\", \"41467257\", \"158607035\", \"132493015\", \"95020…\n$ period_code   <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ decade_code   <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ imdb_id       <int> 1711425, 1343727, 2024544, 1272878, 453562, 1335975, 160…\n$ plot          <chr> NA, NA, \"In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northu…\n$ rated         <chr> NA, NA, \"R\", \"R\", \"PG-13\", \"PG-13\", \"R\", \"R\", \"PG-13\", \"…\n$ response      <chr> NA, NA, \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", \"True\", …\n$ language      <chr> NA, NA, \"English\", \"English, Spanish\", \"English\", \"Engli…\n$ country       <chr> NA, NA, \"USA, UK\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"USA\", \"UK\", \"US…\n$ writer        <chr> NA, NA, \"John Ridley (screenplay), Solomon Northup (base…\n$ metascore     <int> NA, NA, 97, 55, 62, 29, 28, 55, 48, 33, 90, 58, 52, 78, …\n$ imdb_rating   <dbl> NA, NA, 8.3, 6.8, 7.6, 6.6, 5.4, 7.8, 5.7, 5.0, 7.5, 7.4…\n$ director      <chr> NA, NA, \"Steve McQueen\", \"Baltasar Kormákur\", \"Brian Hel…\n$ released      <chr> NA, NA, \"08 Nov 2013\", \"02 Aug 2013\", \"12 Apr 2013\", \"25…\n$ actors        <chr> NA, NA, \"Chiwetel Ejiofor, Dwight Henry, Dickie Gravois,…\n$ genre         <chr> NA, NA, \"Biography, Drama, History\", \"Action, Comedy, Cr…\n$ awards        <chr> NA, NA, \"Won 3 Oscars.

However, U.S. Census data has historically underrepresented marginalized groups so the analysis may not be a complete reflection of the U.S as a whole."
